# Overview

I recently recovered my old Webkinz account from 12 years ago and was so sad to see how much the website had changed since I was a kid. My favorite part of Webkinz was shopping in the "Kinzstore". Now, the whole site is so bogged down with ads that it is almost impossible to use. I decided to recreate the Kinzstore using Firebase.

This version is the employee view as they add inventory to the store. The employee is paid hourly and can update or delete old inventory.

# Cloud Database

I am using a Firestore Database in Firebase. Since this is meant to be a clothing store, the collection is called "clothing".

# Development Environment

I used VS Code as my programming environment. In order to create a detailed UI, I decided to use Javascript and so I can save the payment information to localStorage.
